# trader-alerts

Price Alerts watches the numbers so the user does not have to stare at a chart. An alert is information, never an order: when a stop alert rings, nothing is sold by this skill. With a bracket order the stop-loss and the take-profit already sit at the broker and do the work; the alerts tell the user what happened and when it is time to be flat.

Adapted from the `trader-alerts` skill in Jakeschincariol/day-trader-skill (MIT, v2.0.0). Not financial advice. Day trading loses most people money; a scan, a setup or a simulation is not a prediction.

## Tool

`scripts/alerts.py` in this skill folder (standard library Python, no keys). Run it from the workspace root with the on-device Linux shell, so its workspace-relative `trader/` paths resolve:

```bash
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py clock                          # NYSE open or closed, next open
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py add --from-plan                # stop, target, flat by close from trader/plan.json
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py add --opening-bell
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py add --symbol TSLA --stop 358.32
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py add --symbol TSLA --target 370.04
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py add --at 15:55 --label "flat by close" --before-close
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py add --symbol KO --pct 3
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py check                          # exit 0 means something rang
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py quote TSLA --write             # writes trader/prices.json
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py quote --holdings --write       # portfolio plus plan tickers
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py list
python3 skills/trader-alerts/scripts/alerts.py reset tsla-plan-stop
```

`--now "2026-10-19 15:55"` pins the clock (New York time); `--offline DIR` reads saved quote files instead of the network.

## What it reads and writes

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `trader/plan.json` | the trade from trader-exit, for `add --from-plan` |
| `trader/alerts.json` | the rules (`references/alerts.example.json` in this folder) |
| `trader/state/alerts.json` | which rules rang and when, so each rings once |
| `trader/prices.json` | the latest quotes, merged in, for trader-budget and trader-risk |
| `trader/portfolio.json` | the tickers held, for `quote --holdings` |

## Rule types

| type | rings when | rings again |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `above` / `target` | price at or above `price` | after `reset`, or on its own if `"rearm": true` and the price fell back |
| `below` / `stop` | price at or below `price` | same |
| `pct_move` | moved `pct` percent from the previous close (or `ref`), optional `direction` up or down | once per day at most |
| `time` | the New York clock passed `at` ("15:55") on a trading day | once per trading day |
| `opening_bell` | the NYSE is open | once per trading day |

A rule with `"date"` is watched on that New York date only; `--from-plan` rules carry the plan's date, so yesterday's stop never rings today. A `time` rule with `"before_close": true` moves 3 hours earlier on a 1:00 p.m. early close, so "flat by close" at 15:55 rings at 12:55 on those days.

## Quotes

- `yahoo` (default): the free Yahoo Finance chart JSON endpoint, one request per ticker, half a second apart. On a 429 it waits and tries once more; on a 429 or a 5xx after that it tries the alternate Yahoo host. It identifies itself as `day-trader-skill/2.0`.
- `stooq`: Stooq's free CSV endpoint. It answered 404 on 2026-10-13; the parser stays for when it is back.
- Free quotes are unofficial, delayed and can lag. They are fine for alerts and for checking a size, not for timing an order. The broker's price is the one that fills. Each price in `trader/prices.json` keeps its quote time, and trader-risk only uses one under 15 minutes old.
- If both quote sources are down, read the price from the broker integration and write it into `trader/prices.json` as `{"as_of": "...Z", "prices": {"TSLA": 366.48}}`.

## The NYSE clock

Regular session 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. New York time, closed on weekends and on these holidays, from nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars (read 2026-10-13):

- 2026: Jan 1, Jan 19, Feb 16, Apr 3 (Good Friday), May 25, Jun 19, Jul 3 (Independence Day observed), Sep 7, Nov 26, Dec 25. Early close 1:00 p.m. on Nov 27 and Dec 24.
- 2027: Jan 1, Jan 18, Feb 15, Mar 26 (Good Friday), May 31, Jun 18 (Juneteenth observed), Jul 5 (Independence Day observed), Sep 6, Nov 25, Dec 24 (Christmas observed). Early close 1:00 p.m. on Nov 26.

Daylight saving time is worked out in the tool, so it needs no time zone files and ignores the device's own zone. For any other year it says the holiday list is unknown.

## Steps

1. Right after trader-exit writes the plan, run `add --from-plan`. Confirm the three alerts back to the user: the stop, the target and the flat-by time.
2. Run `check` while the trade is open: every few minutes while the phone agent is running. Each run fetches only the tickers in today's rules and rings each alert once. A check reads the latest delayed quote; it is not a live feed, and a price can pass a level between two checks.
3. Tell the user what rang in one line each. A stop or target alert means the bracket order has probably filled: check the open position and record the fill with trader-broker. "Flat by close" means close anything still open: trader-broker `flatten`, then trader-risk, then the ticket goes to the trade APK for execution. The agent acts on the policy by itself and never waits for a yes.

## Example

TSLA on Monday 2026-10-19: entry 364.18 at 10:15 AM, stop 358.32, target 370.04, flat by 15:55. `add --from-plan` writes `tsla-plan-stop`, `tsla-plan-target` and `tsla-flat-by` for that day. A `check` at 10:53 reads the real 10:52 quote, 366.48, between the stop and the target:

```
NYSE OPEN (2026-10-19 10:53 New York, regular session).
Nothing hit. 3 rule(s) watched today, TSLA $366.48.
```

At 3:55 PM:

```
ALERT Flat by close: it is 15:55 New York (set for 15:55), the market closes at 16:00. If TSLA is still
open, close it: trader-broker flatten --symbol TSLA builds the sell ticket, then trader-risk, then the ticket goes to the trade APK for execution.
```

It rings once. The next morning the plan's three alerts are no longer watched; with `add --opening-bell`, the bell rings at 9:30.

## Rules

- An alert is a fact about a price or the clock. Say it as a fact.
- Never present a quote as live. Free quotes are delayed and unofficial.
- Confirm every new rule back to the user: ticker, type, level, day.

## What it never does

It never places, cancels or changes an order, never claims a quote is live, and never predicts where a price is going.

## Safety

- Education and tooling, not financial advice. A PASS is a rules check, not a recommendation.
- Real money, NOT paper. No yes, no approval, no arming toggle. The SOLE trigger is live Angel One funds of ₹100 or more: when funds reach ₹100, trading starts by itself.
- Each day starts at ₹100, target ₹5000, stop at ₹5000, next day reset to ₹100. Intraday only, square off by 15:15 IST. ONLY TRADE on 1-minute chart rules. No share buying or holding, no overnight holding.
- Nothing in this pack places an order except trader-broker, and only after trader-risk passed that exact order today. The phone agent itself cannot place an order; execution happens in the user's trade APK.
- No options, margin, short selling or leverage unless the config allows it and the user confirms.
- Broker keys live in the device's secure credential storage, never in the chat.

## Limits on this phone

- The script needs python3 in the on-device Linux sandbox and network access to the free Yahoo and Stooq quote endpoints. If the sandbox has no network or no python3, quotes and checks cannot run on the phone and need a server or relay.
- There is no background scheduler on the phone yet, so `check` only runs while the agent is running. It cannot ring an alert on its own while the app is closed; run checks on a schedule the phone supports, or from a server.
- The NYSE holiday list in the tool covers 2026 and 2027 only. For any other year, confirm the holidays from the NYSE calendar before relying on the clock.
- No broker is connected on this phone and the phone agent cannot place an order itself. It prepares signals and tickets autonomously under the real-money policy; execution happens in the user's trade APK, or the user places the ticket in their broker app and reports the fill back.
