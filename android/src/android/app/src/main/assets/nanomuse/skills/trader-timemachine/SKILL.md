# trader-timemachine

The Time Machine sits between the plan and the money. trader-exit has set
the entry, the stop and the target. Before anything is sized or sent, this
skill asks one question: if today plays out like the stock's own last 60
days, how often does this plan hit the target first, the stop first, or
neither? It answers with 10,000 replays and with the real record of the same
rule on every past session. It is a simulation built from the stock's own
recent bars, not a prediction. Day trading loses most people money, and a
good-looking replay does not change that.

This skill is adapted from the day-trader skill pack (MIT, v2.0.0). Run the
tool with python3 in the on-device Linux shell, from this skill's folder:

```bash
python3 timemachine.py run                    # trader/plan.json, 10,000 replays, seed 19
python3 timemachine.py run --write            # also save trader/timemachine.json
python3 timemachine.py run --until 15:55      # end each replay at your flat-by time
python3 timemachine.py run --json
python3 timemachine.py run --symbol TSLA --date 2026-10-19 \
    --entry 364.18 --stop 358.32 --target 370.04 --entry-time "10:15 AM"
python3 timemachine.py chart --from           # ASCII fan chart of the saved run
```

Other flags: `--replays N`, `--seed N` (default 19), `--window N` (default 2
bars), `--offline FILE` (a saved Yahoo chart JSON, `.json` or `.json.gz`),
`--now "2026-10-19 10:15"` (New York time) to pin the clock.

All paths below are workspace-relative. The trader files live under
`trader/` in the workspace, not under any absolute VM path.

## What it reads and writes

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `trader/plan.json` | the plan from trader-exit: symbol, date, entry, entry_time / entry_bar, stop, stop_rule, target, target_r, opening range |
| Yahoo chart API | one request: 60 days of 5-minute bars (`range=60d&interval=5m`), free and unofficial, can lag |
| `trader/timemachine.json` | with `--write`: `{plan, mc, history}` plus the verdict. `mc` holds the odds, percentiles, the fan-chart bands, 160 sample paths and a 24-bin histogram of the close |

## How it works

1. **The pool.** It keeps only FULL sessions before the plan's date: all 78
   five-minute bars, 9:30 to 4:00 New York time. Half days, gaps and today
   are left out. Every bar becomes four ratios to the bar before it:
   open, high, low and close over the previous close.
2. **One replay.** Start at the entry price. For each bar left in the day,
   pick a past bar from the same time of day (plus or minus 2 bars) at
   random, and scale it to the current price. Bar by bar, it checks the stop
   first, then the target. A bar that touches both counts as the stop.
3. **10,000 replays** give four odds. Target first. Stop first. Neither,
   which means the trade was still open at `--until` (default 4:00 PM, the
   close, or 1:00 PM on an NYSE early-close day). Green, which means target
   first or above the entry at `--until`.
   R is +1 at a 1R target, -1 at the stop, and otherwise the distance from
   the entry at `--until` divided by the risk. A gap through the stop still
   counts as -1R here. A real fill can be worse.
4. **The history.** The plan's own rule (the same opening range, stop rule
   and target R) runs again on every one of those past sessions. That is
   what really happened, not a simulation.
5. **The verdict** is one line from the numbers. It looks only at the
   replays that hit one side, and asks how often the target came first. A
   bigger target needs to win less often to break even: 1 in (1 + R). That
   is 50 % at 1R, 33 % at 2R, 25 % at 3R. Less than 5 points from break-even:
   "Close to a coin flip" at 1R, "Close to break-even" at any other R. 5 to
   15 points: "Leans toward the target" or "Leans toward the stop". 15 or
   more: "Strongly toward" one of them. So a 2R plan with target first
   24.1 % and stop first 50.5 % is close to break-even (it needs 33 % of
   the 74.6 % that hit a side, and got 32 %), not a loser.
6. **Below the verdict**, when it applies: a line when more than 40 % of the
   replays hit neither (the price at `--until` decides those), and the
   average R when its sign goes against the lean. Those can only point the
   other way because of the replays that hit neither.

**The seed.** The draws come from Python's `random.Random(seed)`, seed 19 by
default. Same plan, same data, same seed: the same numbers, on any machine.
Say the seed with every result so the user can repeat it.

**5-minute bars only.** Yahoo keeps 60 days of 5-min bars but only about 7
days of 1-min bars, too few sessions for a fair pool. It refuses, in one
plain line, when there are fewer than 20 full sessions, when the entry bar is
not in the data (wrong date, not closed yet, a future day), or when the plan
does not make sense (a stop above a buy's entry, an entry off the 5-minute
grid). A live in-progress bar is never used.

## Steps

1. Make sure `trader/plan.json` is today's plan from trader-exit. If there
   is none, run that first, or pass the plan as flags.
2. Run `timemachine.py run --write`. Add `--until 15:55` when the plan has a
   flat-by time, so "neither" means still open at the time you would get out.
3. Tell the user, in this order: the four odds, the median and the 5 to 95
   range of the price at the close, the average R, the history line, then the
   verdict line and any line under it exactly as printed. Say the seed.
4. If the verdict is a coin flip or close to break-even, say so plainly. Do
   not dress it up. If the history and the replays disagree, say that too.
5. Say once that this is built from the last 60 days and is not a prediction.
   Earnings, news and halts can do things those 60 days never did. Check
   trader-news for the stock before going on.
6. If the user still wants the trade, hand off to trader-budget to size it.

## Example

TSLA, Monday 2026-10-19. The 15-minute opening range is 354.47 to 362.18.
The 10:10 bar closes above it: entry 364.18 at 10:15 AM (bar 8), stop 358.32
(the range midpoint, rounded down), target 370.04 (1R, risk 5.86 a share).

```
10,000 replays of the rest of the session, 10:15 AM to 4:00 PM (69 five-minute bars), seed 19.
  target first   29.4 %
  stop first     25.5 %
  neither        45.1 %   still open at 4:00 PM
  green          51.7 %   target first, or above the entry at 4:00 PM
  Price at 4:00 PM: median 364.36, 90 % of replays between 355.54 and 373.54.
  Average R: +0.034
History: the same rule on each of those 59 real sessions fired 33 times:
13 target, 15 stop, 5 neither. Average R -0.062.
Close to a coin flip: target first 29.4 % vs stop first 25.5 %.
45.1 % of the replays hit neither by 4:00 PM; the price at 4:00 PM decides those.
```

At 1R the target has to come first in half of the replays that hit one
side. It did in 53.6 %. The replays came out close to a coin flip, and the
real history was slightly worse than even. That is the honest answer for this setup, and it is what
the user should hear before trader-budget sizes 8 shares.

## Rules

- Every number comes from the run. Never round a coin flip up into an edge.
- The verdict line and the lines under it are printed by the tool. Repeat
  them, do not rewrite them. Never judge a 2R or 3R plan by target first vs
  stop first alone: the verdict already weighs the target's R.
- Simulated odds are not predictions and not promises. Say it once, plainly.
- Free Yahoo data is unofficial and can lag. Bars are 5-minute bars, checked
  bar by bar, never tick by tick and never real time.
- Always say the seed, so any run can be repeated.
- One plan per run. A changed entry, stop, target or date is a new run.

## What it never does

It never places an order, never sizes a position, never changes the plan,
and never calls a result a sure thing. It never prints a P&L or a profit.
It never uses a bar that has not closed yet, and never mixes today's bars
into the pool.

## Safety

- Education and tooling, not financial advice. A replay result is a simulation, not a recommendation.
- Real money, NOT paper. No yes, no approval, no arming toggle. The SOLE trigger is live Angel One funds of ₹100 or more: when funds reach ₹100, trading starts by itself.
- Each day starts at ₹100, target ₹5000, stop at ₹5000, next day reset to ₹100. Intraday only, square off by 15:15 IST. ONLY TRADE on 1-minute chart rules. No share buying or holding, no overnight holding.
- Nothing in this pack places an order except the order tool, and only after trader-risk passed that exact order today. The phone agent itself cannot place an order; execution happens in the user's trade APK.
- No options, margin, short selling or leverage unless the config allows it and the user confirms.
- Broker keys live in the phone's secure storage, never in the chat. Never
  pay for anything, and never buy or upgrade a data feed or a broker feature
  without the user's explicit order.

## Limits on this phone

- `timemachine.py` is pure standard library Python, but it needs one network
  request to the Yahoo chart API from the on-device shell. If the shell has
  no direct network, fetch the chart through the browser or a server relay
  and use `--offline` with the saved file.
- 10,000 replays is a CPU-heavy run on a phone. It will work, but it can
  take a while and drain battery. Use fewer replays (for example
  `--replays 2000`) for a quick check, and run the full 10,000 on a relay
  or while charging when the exact published numbers matter.
- The tool never trades. A replay result is not a reason to skip the trader-risk check. No user yes is asked anywhere in this pack.
- No broker is connected on this phone and the phone agent cannot place an order itself. It prepares signals and tickets autonomously under the real-money policy; execution happens in the user's trade APK, or the user places the ticket in their broker app and reports the fill back.
